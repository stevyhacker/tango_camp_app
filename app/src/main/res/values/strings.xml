<![CDATA[
<p class="P15"><span class="T3">Dear all :),</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">It seems that this year&#39;s Kolasin tango camp will be full of fun, play and love, as well as many tango and nontango adventures. We have received a large number of registrations which makes it clear that this event has become a true tango Woodstock in the mountains </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3">We wrote the same thing last year. This year it is even more obvious!</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">Accommodation</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">All who have registered for the </span><span class="T4">cheaper accommodation</span><span class="T3">(this is accommodation of good quality for which we have arranged cheaper prices with the accommodation owners who wish to nurture long-term cooperation with the tango camp) can count on getting it, but we have to point out that in some cases, in coordination with you, perhaps we will have to deviate a little from the announced prices and adjust to the situation in the field. This happens rarely and the deviations are small, however it doesn’t hurt to announce such a possibility </span><span class="T10"></span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Please send your accommodation </span><span class="T7">registrations to </span><a href="mailto:tangonaturalmontenegro@gmail.com"><span class="T7">tangonaturalmontenegro@gmail.com</span></a><span class="T7">In the registration you should write:</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T7"><br/></span></p><ol><li><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">1)</span><span class="T7">Dates of arrival and departure</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">2)</span><span class="T7">Number of people</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">3)</span><span class="T7">Upper limit regarding the price</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">4)</span><span class="T7">Do you need internet</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">5)</span><span class="T7">Telephone numbers of everyone in the group (for easier communication in case something needs to be urgently communicated)</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">6)</span><span class="T7">Specific demands if they exist</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">You can certainly count on receiving information regarding your accommodation on time. On time also means a few days before the beginning of the event. For easier making of accommodation combinations, it&#39;s important for us to first receive all the applications, and then do the accommodation arrangements all at once. Considering it is much more feasible for us, when looking for accommodation we will give priority to those who register in clearly defined pairs and groups. In case you don’t have a group (and you don’t plan to be in a single bed room), we suggest that you try to find your roommates for the tango camp through Facebook. We will strive to create groups as well as accommodate those who register solo, but wish to be accommodated together with other people due to prices or any other reasons, however these are situations which can be very complex as everyone has their own dates of arrival and departure and sometimes it is not possible to make a good </span><span class="T3">match… In any case, prices range from 10-14 euros for single bed rooms, 8-10 for double rooms, 7-8 for triple bed rooms, and 6-7 for those with more beds. These are the prices in case you are staying for a minimum of 5 days. All who register before July 10 with clearly formed groups and clear demands regarding accommodation, we guarantee that they will receive adequate accommodation. Everyone else can count on our help, but not a guarantee, in finding accommodation. Another way to look for accommodation is through the website </span><a href="http://www.booking.com"><span class="T7">www.booking.com</span></a></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">Camp schedule</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">A lot of you, who weren&#39;t here last year, have asked about the </span><span class="T4">schedule of activities</span><span class="T3">. A completely accurate schedule is not possible nor will it ever become possible :) as this is an event in the mountains which are strange and unpredictable, and one rainy or windy day can turn the whole day around. In any case, along with many different tango activities, there will be many more other activities that Kolasin and primarily its surroundings offer, so that all who come to the camp, based on the number of days they stay, will have a chance to experience a truly broad range of activities. Even those who come for, say, three days can count on a wealth of activities, while those who only drop by can also count on a nice experience </span><span class="T10"></span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Also, as a less formal event, the Kolasin tango camp opens a lot of possibilities for </span><span class="T4">initiatives</span><span class="T3"> by all the participants that will contribute to an even more fun time for everyone. You can see us as organizers who will do our best to make you feel comfortable, but even more as coordinators of a big tango hangout which will change, sometimes in the moment, based on the needs and desires of the participants, of course if the technical possibilities allow it. It shouldn&#39;t be forgotten that this is an almost free event which practically doesn&#39;t have a budget and which is organized by people who will do all of it (except some specific tours in the mountains etc.) on a voluntary basis. </span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">REGISTRATION PROCESS AND INFO DESK</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">All camp participants should first sign in at the info and registration desk at high school “Braća Selić” (our new main location) upon their arrival to Kolasin, in order to take care of the obligation called "Two euros per day" </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3"> By this we mean the number of days in which you will take part in the camp&#39;s activities. For instance, when you come in the morning, sleep over and stay until the evening, we count this as two days, i.e. four euros. So, you will tell us right away how much you&#39;re planning to stay, we will sign you into the camp book, you will receive your "camp card" and you will pay your support to the event. Here you will also be able to ask everything you&#39;re interested in, then and at any point during the camp, and we will try to have as many ready answers as possible </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3"> Here we will also publish the schedule of activities for the next 1 to 3 days. </span><span class="T4">You will pay for the accommodation</span><span class="T3"> either directly to the apartment owners or to us, but only when the owners are not in Kolasin, so that such an arrangement had been previously made. At the info desk you will also find offers of local agencies which organize other activities, so you can inform yourself here about them as well.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Here are the planned activities so far:</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">Tango activities:</span></p><p class="P13"/><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Tango activities will be organized in three locations: Culture Center of Kolasin, elementary school “Risto Manojlovic” and high school “Braća Selić”. The frist two objects are found at Donji trg (the main town square), while the second and the third are very near Donji trg, at 13. Jul street. We will use the Culture Center only in case there is a need for a third location. </span></p><ol><li><p class="P17" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">1)</span><span class="T3">Classes - the idea is that classes will be mostly organized in the afternoon. The class topics, names of instructors and their level will be announced one, two or three days before on the info board at the info desk in “Braća Selić” high school. The classes will be held by instructors from Tango Natural, as well as other instructors from the region and Europe who are in that moment present in the camp. </span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P18"><span class="T3">The frequency of the classes will depend on the current structure of the visitors and other activities that can be tiring – for instance, an entire-day mountaineering tour </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3"> Considering that this year we will have more locations for classes you can count on us making an even better distinction between levels so that the classes are not very crowded  </span><span class="T10"></span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">2) Practicas - our goal is for the camp to have a high level of interaction and exchange of knowledge so that all those present will take back home, apart from some wonderful memories, lots of new knowledge as well. A large part of the practicas will be either guided or monitored by instructors. Practicas will take place in the first half of the day in the high school (when there are no classes scheduled), as well as some afternoons in this location, as well as in a primary school. Depending on the situation, the gatherings might sometimes spontaneously turn from a practica into a daily milonga. The same goes for the evening practicas. So, some activities will be strictly announced, while some will be coordinated based on the number of people and general level of energy. </span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">3) Milongas – Last year due to the large number of visitors we had milongas almost every night  (main venue, “Braća Selić” high school) even though some of them started as practicas or practicalongas… Considering the number of those who’ve registered, it is certain that this year we will have the same situation. Music at the milongas will be played by DJs who are at that moment in the camp. Their names will be announced 1-3 days ahead.</span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">You can count on milongas in the open (outside) as well! Milongas on the town square with the performance of Tanguango, as well as milongas in the garden of Ski center “Kolasin 1450” are something we can guarantee </span><span class="T10"></span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">4) Video projections and discussions - just like last year, this year we will relatively frequently organize video projections on the subject of Argentine tango. This includes both video clips of performances and other content related to tango culture, with commentary by the clip curators, as well as movies with a tango thematic.</span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">Apart from this we will also try to organize gatherings in a relaxed atmosphere - discussions in which the more experienced tangueros can share their experience and knowledge related to tango as a culture and dance.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">We emphasize that there is a possibility that the mentioned locations will not be open all the time and available for dancing in situations when we estimate that too few people have the strength and will to dance </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3"> - for instance, if all participants were in a intensive mountain tour or if we stayed up dancing until a very late hour the previous night. Still, having in mind the number of people who have registered, most of the time you can count on the possibility of using the mentioned locations for dance, even when a big number of people wishes to do some other activities elsewhere.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">Other activities:</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">We can divide the other activities into those coordinated and prepared by us and those which we can recommend for you which are organized by some of the local tourist agencies that offer an extremely broad range of activities such as rafting in the Tara river, different tours (some of which are incredibly exciting, such as the visit to the canyon Nevidio), jeep safari etc.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Activities within the camp which will be coordinated by the organizer:</span></p><ol><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">1. </span><span class="T3">Different activities focused on working on oneself, such as </span><span class="T4">anti</span><span class="T5">-</span><span class="T4">stress and relax programs</span><span class="T3">, and other activities focused on working on the body, </span><span class="T6">personal </span><span class="T3">expression etc. Like last year, this year we will also have workshops on the subject of </span><span class="T4">contact improvisation, </span><span class="T3">and a new activity will be </span><span class="T4">workshops of modern ballet</span><span class="T3">. </span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P19"><span class="T3">Apart from this we will have </span><span class="T4">yoga </span><span class="T3">classes almost every day! </span></p><p class="P19"><span class="T3">All the mentioned activities are free, i.e. they are included in what you pay in the previously mentioned contribution.</span></p><ol><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">2. </span><span class="T6">This year, like the previous one, we will have workshops of the Argentine folklore dance Chacarera which will be held by Paula Milonguera. She will be at the camp from beginning of August until all the way to the camp&#39;s end.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">3. </span><span class="T3">Educational tours - at the moment this means visits to the botanical garden of Kolasin, as well as botanical tours through which you can find out more about the flora of Kolasin. The entrance fee into the botanical garden is a symbolic 1 euro. Apart from these, we also plan to organize one or more visits to the Moraca endowment of Stefan Nemanja which was built in XI</span><span class="T6">I</span><span class="T3">I century. </span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">4. </span><span class="T3">Horseback riding - there are options of renting horses for an hour or two of riding in the hills nearby, as well as a possibility of organizing day-long tours through the mountains which surround Kolasin. This activity is paid based on the number of horses and the possible hiring of a guide/instructor. In any </span><span class="T3">case, the prices will be significantly cheaper from the regular ones for this type of activities. These activities also depend to a certain extent on the number of horses available at the moment. Signing up for horseback riding is done one or two days before the activity.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">5. </span><span class="T3">Rock climbing - Very close to Kolasin there is a number of pitches (natural rock formations for climbing). We have people who are experts for this activity, as well as the necessary equipment. A bit </span><span class="T6">of your </span><span class="T3">adventurous spirit is needed :) This activity is free. Signing up is necessary one </span><span class="T6">or two </span><span class="T3">day</span><span class="T6">s</span><span class="T3"> in advance.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">6. </span><span class="T3">Cycling - The Tourist Organization of Kolasin will provide us with a large number of bikes </span><span class="T6">for an extremely affordable price</span><span class="T3">. The arrangement is that upon taking the bike one leaves </span><span class="T6">50 cents in the piggy bank </span><span class="T11"></span><span class="T6"> for a ride that will last for up to an hour, while for an entire day of bike riding 1,5 euro is enough! Some of the organizers can join the group and suggest some interesting route if the need arises. </span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">7. </span><span class="T3">Smaller mountain tours and field trips (picnics) - Kolasin is a small town surrounded by numerous mountains and hills. At any point you can decide to go for a shorter or longer visit to the surroundings of Kolasin. In any case, we will occasionally organize shorter, half-day tours and field trips. These activities often take place after a relaxation class in nature, where we simply continue for a walk. Even though a part of the organizers of this event do not eat meat, we will have to satisfy the traditional craving for barbecue</span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3">. In these cases most often a part of the camp participants will stay in Kolasin and dance or take part in other activities, while others enjoy the walk.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">8. </span><span class="T3">Bigger mountain tours - these activities can be dismantled into smaller pieces :) Oftentimes one part of those participating in the tour will at some point make camp and enjoy the nature, food and </span><span class="T6">socializing</span><span class="T3">, while others will proceed to some mountain summit or some other more distant destination. Last year&#39;s field trips to the national park Biogradska Gora, visit to Bjelasica mountain and Komovi mountain have left unforgettable impressions on all who took part. This year we are planning a bigger number of those activities</span><span class="T6">, as well as new destinations</span><span class="T3">. These activities include certain additional expenses related to transport, food - if barbecue is organized, and possible daily fee for the guide if he/she is needed.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P20"> </p><p class="P15"><span class="T6">If you play some musical instrument, have a telescope (this is because of last year&#39;s educational session which lasted until late into the night </span><span class="T11"></span><span class="T6"> ) or anything similar which can contribute to wealth of activities, please do not hesitate to contribute. </span><span class="T5">So far we have planned some archery (bow and arrow) activities.</span><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">Clothing and footwear necessary for the camp</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">You know what you need for tango </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3">Nights in Kolasin can be quite cool (temperature can fall down to 5 degrees Celsius, most often to 13-14, sometimes even warmer), even though the temperature during the day can go over 30 degrees, which is also a common occurrence. It is good to take this into account. Also, some days can be colder because the mountain weather is occasionally unstable. If rain falls or it gets cold, we will dance more, in a very closed embrace :)</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Also, field trips and mountain tours require appropriate clothing and footwear. The majority of all tours can be done in regular sneakers, but one part of the activities includes possibilities of climbing to mountain summits and crossing demanding terrain, so it&#39;s necessary to have adequate mountaineering footwear. </span><span class="T6">We cannot allow those who do not have adequate footwear to join a group which is climbing some more demanding mountain summit! Of course, these activities are optional. </span><span class="T3">For instance, a part of those on the field trip can stay and relax next to a tree and/or barbecue </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3"> while the others will proceed to a mountain summit. It is recommended that you take layers of clothes so that you can adjust yourself to the temperature. Also, you should take, for example, several t-shirts, as during mountain climbing people tend to sweat a lot and it is good to change clothes.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">Food and drinks at the </span><span class="T5">camp</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">The official restaurant of the tango camp </span><span class="T3">will this year also support this event with extremely low food prices! The price for one meal which includes soup, salad and main course will be only 4,5 euros. You can count that every day there will also be a vegetarian food option in the menu.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Apart from that, within the Spomen dom location there will be a bar open exclusively to the tango camp.

\n The official restaurant of the tango camp will this year also support this event with extremely low food prices! The price for one meal which includes soup, salad and main course will be only 4,5 euros. You can count that every day there will also be a vegetarian food option in the menu.
Apart from that, within the Spomen dom location there will be a bar open exclusively to the tango camp. You will find both food and drinks there at very affordable prices. The choice of food will depend on the experience on the ground. In any case, you can count on a relatively wide selection of sandwiches etc. Most, if not all accommodation has a kitchen so you can also organize your own food preparation.

    <string name="activities_text">
            <![CDATA[
<p class="P15"><span class="T4">Tango activities:</span></p><p class="P13"/><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Tango activities will be organized in three locations: Culture Center of Kolasin, elementary school “Risto Manojlovic” and high school “Braća Selić”. The frist two objects are found at Donji trg (the main town square), while the second and the third are very near Donji trg, at 13. Jul street. We will use the Culture Center only in case there is a need for a third location. </span></p><ol><li><p class="P17" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">1)</span><span class="T3">Classes - the idea is that classes will be mostly organized in the afternoon. The class topics, names of instructors and their level will be announced one, two or three days before on the info board at the info desk in “Braća Selić” high school. The classes will be held by instructors from Tango Natural, as well as other instructors from the region and Europe who are in that moment present in the camp. </span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P18"><span class="T3">The frequency of the classes will depend on the current structure of the visitors and other activities that can be tiring – for instance, an entire-day mountaineering tour </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3"> Considering that this year we will have more locations for classes you can count on us making an even better distinction between levels so that the classes are not very crowded  </span><span class="T10"></span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">2) Practicas - our goal is for the camp to have a high level of interaction and exchange of knowledge so that all those present will take back home, apart from some wonderful memories, lots of new knowledge as well. A large part of the practicas will be either guided or monitored by instructors. Practicas will take place in the first half of the day in the high school (when there are no classes scheduled), as well as some afternoons in this location, as well as in a primary school. Depending on the situation, the gatherings might sometimes spontaneously turn from a practica into a daily milonga. The same goes for the evening practicas. So, some activities will be strictly announced, while some will be coordinated based on the number of people and general level of energy. </span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">3) Milongas – Last year due to the large number of visitors we had milongas almost every night  (main venue, “Braća Selić” high school) even though some of them started as practicas or practicalongas… Considering the number of those who’ve registered, it is certain that this year we will have the same situation. Music at the milongas will be played by DJs who are at that moment in the camp. Their names will be announced 1-3 days ahead.</span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">You can count on milongas in the open (outside) as well! Milongas on the town square with the performance of Tanguango, as well as milongas in the garden of Ski center “Kolasin 1450” are something we can guarantee </span><span class="T10"></span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">4) Video projections and discussions - just like last year, this year we will relatively frequently organize video projections on the subject of Argentine tango. This includes both video clips of performances and other content related to tango culture, with commentary by the clip curators, as well as movies with a tango thematic.</span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T3">Apart from this we will also try to organize gatherings in a relaxed atmosphere - discussions in which the more experienced tangueros can share their experience and knowledge related to tango as a culture and dance.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">We emphasize that there is a possibility that the mentioned locations will not be open all the time and available for dancing in situations when we estimate that too few people have the strength and will to dance </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3"> - for instance, if all participants were in a intensive mountain tour or if we stayed up dancing until a very late hour the previous night. Still, having in mind the number of people who have registered, most of the time you can count on the possibility of using the mentioned locations for dance, even when a big number of people wishes to do some other activities elsewhere.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">Other activities:</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">We can divide the other activities into those coordinated and prepared by us and those which we can recommend for you which are organized by some of the local tourist agencies that offer an extremely broad range of activities such as rafting in the Tara river, different tours (some of which are incredibly exciting, such as the visit to the canyon Nevidio), jeep safari etc.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Activities within the camp which will be coordinated by the organizer:</span></p><ol><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">1. </span><span class="T3">Different activities focused on working on oneself, such as </span><span class="T4">anti</span><span class="T5">-</span><span class="T4">stress and relax programs</span><span class="T3">, and other activities focused on working on the body, </span><span class="T6">personal </span><span class="T3">expression etc. Like last year, this year we will also have workshops on the subject of </span><span class="T4">contact improvisation, </span><span class="T3">and a new activity will be </span><span class="T4">workshops of modern ballet</span><span class="T3">. </span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P19"><span class="T3">Apart from this we will have </span><span class="T4">yoga </span><span class="T3">classes almost every day! </span></p><p class="P19"><span class="T3">All the mentioned activities are free, i.e. they are included in what you pay in the previously mentioned contribution.</span></p><ol><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">2. </span><span class="T6">This year, like the previous one, we will have workshops of the Argentine folklore dance Chacarera which will be held by Paula Milonguera. She will be at the camp from beginning of August until all the way to the camp&#39;s end.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">3. </span><span class="T3">Educational tours - at the moment this means visits to the botanical garden of Kolasin, as well as botanical tours through which you can find out more about the flora of Kolasin. The entrance fee into the botanical garden is a symbolic 1 euro. Apart from these, we also plan to organize one or more visits to the Moraca endowment of Stefan Nemanja which was built in XI</span><span class="T6">I</span><span class="T3">I century. </span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">4. </span><span class="T3">Horseback riding - there are options of renting horses for an hour or two of riding in the hills nearby, as well as a possibility of organizing day-long tours through the mountains which surround Kolasin. This activity is paid based on the number of horses and the possible hiring of a guide/instructor. In any </span><span class="T3">case, the prices will be significantly cheaper from the regular ones for this type of activities. These activities also depend to a certain extent on the number of horses available at the moment. Signing up for horseback riding is done one or two days before the activity.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">5. </span><span class="T3">Rock climbing - Very close to Kolasin there is a number of pitches (natural rock formations for climbing). We have people who are experts for this activity, as well as the necessary equipment. A bit </span><span class="T6">of your </span><span class="T3">adventurous spirit is needed :) This activity is free. Signing up is necessary one </span><span class="T6">or two </span><span class="T3">day</span><span class="T6">s</span><span class="T3"> in advance.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">6. </span><span class="T3">Cycling - The Tourist Organization of Kolasin will provide us with a large number of bikes </span><span class="T6">for an extremely affordable price</span><span class="T3">. The arrangement is that upon taking the bike one leaves </span><span class="T6">50 cents in the piggy bank </span><span class="T11"></span><span class="T6"> for a ride that will last for up to an hour, while for an entire day of bike riding 1,5 euro is enough! Some of the organizers can join the group and suggest some interesting route if the need arises. </span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">7. </span><span class="T3">Smaller mountain tours and field trips (picnics) - Kolasin is a small town surrounded by numerous mountains and hills. At any point you can decide to go for a shorter or longer visit to the surroundings of Kolasin. In any case, we will occasionally organize shorter, half-day tours and field trips. These activities often take place after a relaxation class in nature, where we simply continue for a walk. Even though a part of the organizers of this event do not eat meat, we will have to satisfy the traditional craving for barbecue</span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3">. In these cases most often a part of the camp participants will stay in Kolasin and dance or take part in other activities, while others enjoy the walk.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P21" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:NaNcm;">8. </span><span class="T3">Bigger mountain tours - these activities can be dismantled into smaller pieces :) Oftentimes one part of those participating in the tour will at some point make camp and enjoy the nature, food and </span><span class="T6">socializing</span><span class="T3">, while others will proceed to some mountain summit or some other more distant destination. Last year&#39;s field trips to the national park Biogradska Gora, visit to Bjelasica mountain and Komovi mountain have left unforgettable impressions on all who took part. This year we are planning a bigger number of those activities</span><span class="T6">, as well as new destinations</span><span class="T3">. These activities include certain additional expenses related to transport, food - if barbecue is organized, and possible daily fee for the guide if he/she is needed.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P20"> </p><p class="P15"><span class="T6">If you play some musical instrument, have a telescope (this is because of last year&#39;s educational session which lasted until late into the night </span><span class="T11"></span><span class="T6"> ) or anything similar which can contribute to wealth of activities, please do not hesitate to contribute. </span><span class="T5">So far we have planned some archery (bow and arrow) activities.</span><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T4">Clothing and footwear necessary for the camp</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">You know what you need for tango </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3">Nights in Kolasin can be quite cool (temperature can fall down to 5 degrees Celsius, most often to 13-14, sometimes even warmer), even though the temperature during the day can go over 30 degrees, which is also a common occurrence. It is good to take this into account. Also, some days can be colder because the mountain weather is occasionally unstable. If rain falls or it gets cold, we will dance more, in a very closed embrace :)</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T3">Also, field trips and mountain tours require appropriate clothing and footwear. The majority of all tours can be done in regular sneakers, but one part of the activities includes possibilities of climbing to mountain summits and crossing demanding terrain, so it&#39;s necessary to have adequate mountaineering footwear. </span><span class="T6">We cannot allow those who do not have adequate footwear to join a group which is climbing some more demanding mountain summit! Of course, these activities are optional. </span><span class="T3">For instance, a part of those on the field trip can stay and relax next to a tree and/or barbecue </span><span class="T10"></span><span class="T3"> while the others will proceed to a mountain summit. It is recommended that you take layers of clothes so that you can adjust yourself to the temperature. Also, you should take, for example, several t-shirts, as during mountain climbing people tend to sweat a lot and it is good to change clothes.</span></p>
